| `requests_processing` | 4 |

Highest sampled value was **3.62 of 4** slots. Note this gauge is llama.cpp's *average* busy slots per decode step, so the number below is the highest average we sampled, not an instantaneous maximum batch width. A peak near 1 means
requests were served one at a time -- either the load was too light to overlap, or
they arrived too far apart. A peak approaching `--parallel` means the scheduler was
genuinely packing concurrent requests into shared decode steps.
`requests_deferred` went above zero: more requests arrived than there were slots, so some waited. That wait is the queue time in your P95.

## Your observation

The sampled busy-slot gauge peaked at 3.62 of 4, close to Locust's 3.7 effective
concurrency. They measure different things: the server gauge averages concurrently
decoding slots, while Little's Law includes queued requests and Locust counts completed
requests. The 46 deferred requests confirm queueing; I trust the server gauge for active
slot occupancy and Locust for end-to-end occupancy.
